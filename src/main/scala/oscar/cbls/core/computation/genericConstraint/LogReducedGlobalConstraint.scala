/** The log-reduced global constraint is a secondary approach to pre-computation and constraint
  * evaluation.
  *
  * In the original global constraint, the pre-computation computes the value over each
  * sub-sequences of node. This can be really expensive (O(nÂ²)) but the constraint evaluation during
  * the neighborhood exploration is in O(s) where s in the number of segments. The secondary
  * approach aims to reduce the complexity of the pre-computation to the detriment of the constraint
  * evaluation's complexity. Leading to a complexity of O(n) for the precomputation phase and a
  * complexity of O(log n) for the evaluation of a solution.
  *
  * __How does it work ?__
  *
  * Classical global constraint :
  *   - For each pair of nodes in a vehicle's route, precompute some data ([[T]]) to speed up the
  *     constraint evaluation phase.
  *   - Cut the [[oscar.cbls.algo.sequence.IntSequence]] into [[Segment]] based on
  *     insertion/moving/removing coordinates.
  *   - Use [[Segment]] precomputed data to compute the output value as fast as possible.
  *
  * Log reduced global constraint :
  *   - Decompose each route in steps of size (1,2,4,8,16...) (2^0^, 2^1^, 2^2^...) (see
  *     [[decomposeToBitNumbersMSBFirst]] for more details)
  *   - For each step, precompute some data ([[T]]) to speed up the constraint evaluation phase.
  *   - Cut the [[oscar.cbls.algo.sequence.IntSequence]] into [[Segment]] based on
  *     insertion/moving/removing coordinates.
  *   - Decorate the [[Segment]] to form [[LogReducedSegment]] (see [[decorateSegments]] for more
  *     details).
  *   - Use [[LogReducedSegment]] precomputed data to compute the output value as fast as possible.

  * @param vrp

  * @param name
  *   The (optional) name of the Invariant.
  * @tparam T
  *   Parametrized type that represents the value associated to each precomputed step. For example,
  *   type `Long` could be associated to `RouteLength`; in that case, each precomputed step would
  *   contain the length of this step.
  * @tparam U
  *   Parametrized type that represents the output type of the constraint, for example, `Long` for
  *   `RouteLength` (the total distance).
