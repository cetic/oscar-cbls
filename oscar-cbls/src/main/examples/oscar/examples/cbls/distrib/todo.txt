    //improvement1: how to get feedback on the go from remote worker in case of Atomic? ie: console and obj?
    //rule so far: not possible to get out of the distributed combinator without stopping the workers.
    //  btw: this is not strognly implemented, the combinators must be honest
    //idea: propoze a remoteAtomic with dedicated API?
    //NB: this is just for verbosities so not very relevant indeed.
    //improvement2: how to sent only the delta on the model instead of the model itself in order to spare on model loading nd serialization?
    //improvement5: remote
    //improvement9: VLSN
